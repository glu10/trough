* Fake feeds rule examples and testing.
* Read story tracking
* Write more unit tests

## Medium Priority
* Drag and drop persistent feed ordering
* Categories for feeds (ListStore -> TreeStore)
* Persistent view widgets sizing
* Bottom status bar to communicate progress of network requests
* Create Trough icon.
* No/aborted connection error handling.
* Change cache to be time-based rather than use-based.

## Low Priority
* Ctrl+Scroll on-the-fly adjustment of font size (would require writing preferences on_quit())
